      <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
      <p>I'm Zoe Fingleton, a sophomore at Smith College, pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Religion. My primary interest lies in exploring the ethical implications of AI integration in data collection and how its application can impact user experience in the digital world.</p>
      <p>I have experience with research, data science, machine learning, deep learning, software development, robotics, and data analysis. I've developed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ys0_J__TU2u01V7JlBehTKKIUS3Buzvm/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">novel algorithm</a> for self-supervised learning using a siamese network, built and programmed an <a href="https://github.com/zoefing/fire-fighting-robot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autonomous robot</a> capable of navigating mazes and extinguishing fires, read Descartes and Turing alike, worked with international humanitarian groups, hosted a <a href="https://wozq919fm.mixlr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radio show</a>, and conducted extensive research alone, in pairs, and large groups. </p>
      <h3>Currently</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>This fall, I am serving as a student mentor for the course EGR 100mr: Mobile Robot Design with the Smith College Engineering department.</li>
         <li>When I'm in New York, I spend my Sundays volunteering with the <a href="https://www.hastingszerowaste.org/home/tili-garage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TILI Garage</a>, a zero waste initiative in my hometown that embodies the ethos of "one man's trash is another man's treasure." </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Previously</h3>
      <ul>
         <li> Over the summer, I pursued research through a REU with the WPI <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science</a> and <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/electrical-computer-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> departments in the field of Computer Vision, with a focus on developing a new algorithm for self-supervised learning. My work was made possible with funding from the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-experiences-undergraduates-reu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Science Foundation</a></li>
         <li> From July through October 2023, I interned at <a href="https://www.kite.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KITE Global</a>, where I spearheaded the research and selection process of survey evaluation tools for the company's expansion. I was also involved in the collection and organization of response data from workshops and meetings with global humanitarian organizations, including the UNDP and WFP.   </li>
         <li> I recently wrapped up my participation in the inaugural <a href="https://www.seo-usa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEO Tech Developer First Year Academy</a>, where I completed independent coursework built upon an intensive Python curriculum and collaborated on paired project work to develop a <a href="https://github.com/zoefing/fishing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a> from scratch. </li>
         <li> I have also worked part-time in various customer service positions, including at a bustling restaurant in the suburbs of New York City for one year and my local town pool for the previous two years. These roles have formed a toolset for conflict resolution, effective interpersonal communication, and patience. </li>
      </ul>
