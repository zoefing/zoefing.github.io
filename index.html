      <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
      <p>I'm Zoe Fingleton, a junior at Smith College, pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Religion. I am deeply interested, and invested, in the relationship between creator and machine. How do we use technology for work? For play? In what ways do our interactions frame how we go about navigating both online and offline spaces?  My primary interest lies in balancing digital ethics with technological advancement, and exploring how the social implications of machine learning work in tandem with progress.</p>
      <p>I have experience with research in machine learning, computer vision, and reproducibility. I've developed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ys0_J__TU2u01V7JlBehTKKIUS3Buzvm/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">novel algorithm</a> for self-supervised learning using a siamese network, built and programmed an <a href="https://github.com/zoefing/fire-fighting-robot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autonomous robot</a> capable of navigating mazes and extinguishing fires, read Descartes and Turing alike, worked with international humanitarian groups, hosted a <a href="https://wozq919fm.mixlr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radio show</a>, and conducted extensive research alone, in pairs, and in groups. </p>
      <h3>Currently</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>This semester at Smith, I am taking courses in Theory of Computation, Linear Algebra, and the Study of Buddhism, as well as a seminar in Accessible Computing. </li>
         <li>I'm part of <a href="https://www.smith.edu/people/michael-robson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Robson's</a> high-performance computing lab, where I'm working on a project in reproducibility. </li>
         <li>I am the treasurer and co-secretary of Don't Blink Media, Smith's one and only firlm production club.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Previously</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>This past summer, I conducted research through a REU with the UCCS <a href="https://eas.uccs.edu/departments/computer-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Science</a> department in the field of Natural Language Processing, with a focus on applications of LLMs for validation & verification. My work is made possible with funding from the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-experiences-undergraduates-reu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSF</a>.</li>
         <li>Last spring at Smith, I completed courses in Modal Logic, Discrete Math, and Microprocessors and Assembly language.
         <li>In April, I participated in the ASA Five College DataFest, where I worked on the analysis of real estate data.</li>
         <li>Over the summer of 2024, I pursued research through a REU with the WPI <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science</a> and <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/electrical-computer-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> departments in the field of Computer Vision, with a focus on developing a new algorithm for self-supervised learning. My work was funded by the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-experiences-undergraduates-reu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSF</a>.</li>
         <li>In January 2024 I participated in the inaugural <a href="https://www.seo-usa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEO Tech Developer First Year Academy</a>, where I completed independent coursework built upon an intensive Python curriculum and collaborated on paired project work to develop a <a href="https://github.com/zoefing/fishing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a> from scratch. </li>
         <li>From July through October 2023, I interned at <a href="https://www.kite.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KITE Global</a>, where I spearheaded the research and selection process of survey evaluation tools for the company's expansion. I was also involved in the collection and organization of response data from workshops and meetings with global humanitarian organizations, including the UNDP and WFP. </li>
         <li>I have also worked part-time in various customer service positions, including at a bustling restaurant in the suburbs of New York City for one year and at my local town pool for the previous two years. These roles have formed a toolset for conflict resolution, effective interpersonal communication, and patience. </li>
      </ul>
